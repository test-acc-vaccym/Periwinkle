# Periwinkle
Periwinkle is an upcoming app that will allow you to set a codeword. The app will then read a specified contact's incoming texts
for that set codeword. This can be used for things such as descrete texting, safety, etc. 
## Disclaimer
While this app is designed to read text messages, it does <b><i>not</i></b> send any of these text messages to a server, does not have
any internet access, and does not store the information that is read. The only information that is stored is the codeword that you manually
input into the app, and a copy of the text message that contained that codeword. No person will see this information except for the person
that downloads the app.
